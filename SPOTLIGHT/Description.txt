Shadowhacker, the Bureau’s next target is a jackpot machine buried deep within a heavily compressed binary. The house has locked it behind layers of protection, but you’ve been chosen to break through. Your mission is to unpack the system and inject a well-placed nudge at the perfect moment to alter the outcome.

Once inside, the machine's random spins can be manipulated—but only if you breach the layers without triggering the house's alarms.
Remember, the jackpot won’t come from luck alone—it will take skill, strategy
