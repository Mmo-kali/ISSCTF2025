1. **Locate the File:**
   - The first step is to find the file in question on the disk image. You need to navigate to the **Users** directory, then go to **Desktop > script > testData**. Inside the **testData** folder, you will find the file named **importantData**. This file is likely password-protected, and your task is to extract the password to open it.

2. **Find the Password:**
   - The password for the **importantData** file is hidden within a screenshot taken by the user. The user was interacting with an **online password strength tester**. The screenshot shows the user entering their password into the tool, revealing the password that was used to protect the **importantData** file.

3. **Access the File:**
   - Once you find the screenshot containing the password, you can use it to unlock the **importantData** file.
