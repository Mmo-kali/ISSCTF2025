John prides himself on his cybersecurity expertise. He boasts about having a "very secure password" and is quick to point out flaws in others' setups. Recently, he sent us a picture of his keyboard, claiming it’s a pristine example of security-conscious hardware.

But there’s a twist: John missed something important. While examining the photo, we noticed a subtle detail he overlooked. Knowing that John loves to have things in alphabetical order and is a stickler for the saying "height matters," we suspect his password might not be as secure as he claims.John also loves the number 3 he always says he repeats things 3 times just to be sure.






CHALLENGE.

The user just has to look at which row is higher and in that row which keys are worn out and which one has the first order
in the alphabet.

They will get:

$4QRYAFHLNZ

Repeat it 3 times and thats the flag.

FLAG:$4QRYAFHLNZ$4QRYAFHLNZ$4QRYAFHLNZ
