Mount the Disk Image: First, mount the disk image you recovered to access its contents. You can use tools like Autopsy or FTK Imager to mount the disk image and explore it.

Navigate to the User Directory: Once the disk image is mounted, go to the user directory for Alice. This can typically be found under /Users/Alice/ or C:\Users\Alice\.

Go to Alice's Desktop: On Alice's user folder, navigate to the Desktop folder.

Locate the Flag: The flag is located on Alice's Desktop. Look for a file that contains the flag in the format FLAG{...}.
