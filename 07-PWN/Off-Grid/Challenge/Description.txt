Our intelligence has intercepted a rogue program in our power grid systems believed to be the work of the Black Hat Bureau. This program appears innocuous but contains a hidden vulnerability that could compromise critical systems if exploited. Your task is to expose the Bureau's plans before they can strike us.

You'll need to push the limits of your skills to reveal the Bureau's secrets. Good Luck Operative
