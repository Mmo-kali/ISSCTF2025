API Challenge: Retrieve the Flag
Introduction
Welcome to the API challenge! Your mission is to explore the documentation for a custom API that we’ve set up. At the bottom of this page, you’ll find a link to the API documentation. Your goal is to retrieve the flag by following the steps outlined below.

Steps to Retrieve the Flag
API Documentation:
Visit the API documentation (link provided below).
Familiarize yourself with the available endpoints and their functionalities.
Debugging Token:
In the API documentation, search for the default API debugging token.
This token will be necessary for authentication.
Make a POST Request:
Using the debugging token, make a POST request to the API.
The endpoint will return a list of files that the API has access to.
One of these files will be named flag.txt.
Retrieve the Flag:
Once you identify flag.txt, make a GET request to the API specifically for that file.
The contents of flag.txt will reveal the flag!
