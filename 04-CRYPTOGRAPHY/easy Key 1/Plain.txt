“Sometimes, the answers we seek are hidden in plain sight. The key lies not in what you look at, but in what you see.”

You’re on a mission, and the key to success is the password. But be careful—don’t take anything for granted.
The password is the key, and the key is the flag. What seems obvious might not be the answer you’re looking for.
The challenge may appear simple, but if you don't know what you're after, it could become impossibly complex.

Your task is to use the password provided to you: Th3SecretKey123!&. Remember, sometimes adding just a little & can change everything,
turning something ordinary into the key that unlocks it all. Explore every angle,
check every detail, and keep in mind that the simplest things can often be the most deceptive.

Good luck—remember, it’s all hidden in plain sight.
