Description

Hello Agent, We managed to get this secret file with some hases inside we don't seem to know what to do with them.
We think you can figure it out. Once you have the passwords in plaintext concatenate them with a _ and use SHA244 before
you send it back to us as the flag. Make sure to know what type of hash it is or you'll never get it. Good luck!!

They must go on hashcat and identify the hashes, break them, and then mix them with a _ and use SHA224 on the broken password

Final flag is
