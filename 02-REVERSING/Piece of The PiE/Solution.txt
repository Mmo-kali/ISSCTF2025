Look at the flow of the disassembled binary, and you'll find that there is a comparison with '2' which leads to a block where stuff like 'GetCurrentProcessId', 'OpenProcess', 'WriteProcessMemory' is being called.

Safe assumption that it means on the third run it'll execute that (you'll need to have run the binary initially before disassembly)

Run twice and you'll arrive to 'GetCurrentProcessId', go step by step until you find 'WriteProcessMemory'

Look at the documentation, it says the args for 'WriteProcessMemory' are as follows: 
BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
  [in]  HANDLE  hProcess,
  [in]  LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
  [in]  LPCVOID lpBuffer,
  [in]  SIZE_T  nSize,
  [out] SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
);

They will be in that order in the stack, pull the 'lpbuffer' as that is the flag

Base64 decode it and then reverse the string, you'll get the corrected flag
