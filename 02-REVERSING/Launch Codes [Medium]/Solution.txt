Trial Run binary to see what it actually does

Open Binary in a disassembler (Cutter, IDA, etc.) and look for "readLine" call as it is only reading user input once

Place a breakpoint at that at "readLine" and then look how the flow goes.

you'll come across a call for "chk", its return value is stored in eax which is moved somewhere right after

step into chk and continue on till you come across the an instance of string comparison (eqstring), flip the ZF there before jmp

you'll have the flag decoded.
