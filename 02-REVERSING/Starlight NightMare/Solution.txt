1Look for xor_encrypt, xor_decrypt, combineKeys, and win

2 secret key is formed at runtime via combineKeys(), and the final function win() is referenced by a hidden pointer.

3 combineKeys(), and the final function win() is referenced by a hidden pointer.


4 enter "UnbreakableP@ssw0rd!" you got from strings

5 The secret key is stored in two parts: partialKey1 and partialKey2

6 get the Encrypted Key from the program.

Decrypt key 

for i in range(len(encryptedKey)):
    decrypted[i] = encryptedKey[i] ^ (OBFUSCATION_KEY + (i * 5))
