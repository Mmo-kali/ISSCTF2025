> Preferably Unpack the first exe, and look through it, you'll find a call for IsDebuggerPresent(), manipulate ZF in debugger to jmp over it or binary patch it
> find the condition for creation of second stage file (x = 4) (either in debugging or by unpacking the binary with UPX)
> get the second file and find the function which was not called ("__"), grab the address and patch the binary to call it.
