Operative, we have recieved a suspicious executable, it seems to be erratic in behaviour. 
We have reason to belive one of our undercover agents embedded critical information in it.
Analyse the behavior and retrieve the information. Good Luck!

Users will be provided 'Sneaky.exe' & 'ctfdll.dll'
In Light of Malware Warnings due to the techniques used in the executables I reccommend providing the exe in a password protected and explicit instructions to only run in a virtual enviroment.
