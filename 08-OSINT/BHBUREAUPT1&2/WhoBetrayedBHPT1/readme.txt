Task Part 1: The Black Hat Bureau remains at large. Not only have they managed to release the identities of Anonymous and pulled off what is considered to be the greatest hack of all time â€“ disabling the entire American electrical power grid, all while remaining in the shadows. They recently announced their next plan to collapse the global economy; however, our department has received an anonymous .zip from a burner email.
But before we begin investigating into the contents of the .zip, we have to figure out who it came from. There seems to be a couple chatlogs that might help you find out who.
