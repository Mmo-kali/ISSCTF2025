[2024-09-13 23:05:10] <Snakerifle> Have you finished setting things up in the south side of the place?
[2024-09-13 23:05:25] <Kendricklamar> Yeah, everything’s locked in. Cameras are on the west road 5km out
[2024-09-13 23:05:43] <d@rius> Good, because they’re already sniffing us out – the locals are getting sus
[2024-09-13 23:06:00] <oliberb> Think they’re onto you guys? Might be time to relocate no?
[2024-09-13 23:06:15] <Jtow> Nah, they’re still clear. Location’s remote enough that they won’t find them for weeks
[2024-09-13 23:06:35] <Snakerifle> Agreed. It’s a big house but its not that suspicious
[2024-09-13 23:06:52] <Kendricklamar> Exactly. Besides, the signal relays we set up will throw them off by a few hundred miles
[2024-09-13 23:07:10] <d@rius> But couldn’t they just triangulate? I’m not too sure about staying in the same place for a long time
[2024-09-13 23:07:30] <oliberb> Worst case, you guys split to the safehouse on the other island. No way they’ll reach y’all there
[2024-09-13 23:07:45] <Snakerifle> If it comes to that, we’re prepped. But for now, we’re chillin
[2024-09-13 23:08:02] <Jtow> Anyone make a drop at the location in Sauga yet? We need eyes on that place
[2024-09-13 23:08:18] <d@rius> Nah. That location’s a decoy, keep everyone focused on it by having our VPNs there while we work elsewhere
[2024-09-13 23:08:32] <Kendricklamar> Right, they’ll waste time chasing nothing
[2024-09-13 23:08:50] <oliberb> I checked the cams earlier. No movement. They’re nowhere near us right now
[2024-09-13 23:09:08] <Snakerifle> Perfect. We keep letting them think we’re setting up near Sauga, meanwhile, we’re halfway across the world
[2024-09-13 23:09:22] <Kendricklamar> Just need to keep this going until we finish the final phase
[2024-09-13 23:09:38] <d@rius> I’m lowkey getting excited about this
[2024-09-13 23:09:50] <oliberb> Keep the noise down, though. We shouldn’t be talking in non-encrypted channels rn
[2024-09-13 23:10:05] <Snakerifle> He’s right. Stay quiet, keep moving. Sauga will be their best guess, and by then we're long gone
