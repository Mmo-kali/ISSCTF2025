Listen.

You've received the .zip from the burner email I purposefully made traceable.

There's a reason I sent it over. 

The things we saw.

The things we did.

The money we made. 

Wasn't worth it.

I know you're trying to find who sent this email, and I don't blame you.

By the time you found out, I'll be long gone. I got my share, I got my passports changed, so go ahead.

I'll even give you a hint.

When you find my name, find an alias, supposedly tied to the leak of Black Hat Bureau... look at my email for the next steps.

Cheers.
