Task Part 2: Great job detective. Our encryption specialists uncovered some hidden files in the .zip you were given previously that may give hint to where parts of the Black Hat Bureau may stay.
You’ve been tasked to go through this .zip again to see if there’s anything within it that can pinpoint the members’ primary location, specifically, the coordinates of the house they are staying at. The shadows can’t hide them forever.
To get the flag, multiply the first 4 digits of each coordinate together and include the decimal: 12.5623498 * 38.3405932 = 12.56 * 38.34 = 481.5504
